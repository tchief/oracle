# Oracle


## [PLAY HERE (Github Pages + Azure)](https://tchief.github.io/oracle/)
Use hotkeys when you play (**'['**, **']'** - yes/no; **'l'** - list all; '**r**', '**s**' - restart/submit).

## Demo
![Demo v1: Doughnut](doughnut.gif?raw=true "Doughnut")
![Demo v2: Lorem](lorem.gif?raw=true "Lorem")

## Notes
I focused on features, client-side, UX, CD and having fun.
There is no tests now, here's a [place](https://github.com/tchief/shop) to look for an example of my approach to tests & postman & coverage report for .NET Core API backend.
All questions are faker-generated now, I'll add some real later.
